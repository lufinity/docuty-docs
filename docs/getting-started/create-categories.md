# Create Categories

## What is a Category?
Categories can be anything you like it to be. It is what you want documented in Docuty and is a kind of a blueprint filled with attributes.

You can for example create a category named "Servers" and document all your customers servers to help you or your colleagues out when working with their environment. Or maybe you want to keep track of all your best friends so you create a category named "Pet Animals" and then create some sub categories like "Dogs", "Cats", or "Turtles". The choice is yours!

## Creating a Category
Before creating a category, you need to figure out what kind of attributes you will be needing and make sure they exist in the attribute table. To learn more about attributes, go to Attributes.

When you're sure that all attributes you need exist click on "Settings" and then "Categories" which will lead you to the Category table. Here you can see all existing categories as well as create a new. To do so, click on "New".

A pop-up will appear with a couple of fields. Here are a short description on what they are.

- Name - This is what Docuty uses as an identifier in the background. This need to be unique for all categories and needs to be in lower case. Alphanumeric characters, underlines (_) and dashes (-) are the only characters permitted.

- Label - This is what you will see in Docuty, what will be shown in the navigation (if you choose to display it there) and on other places. This is how the end users identifies the category.

- Icon - As you might have guessed, this specifies what icon that will be associated with the category. If you can't find any suiting icons or want to know what icons are available, please go to Icons.

- Show in navigation bar - This specifies if the category will be shown in your left navigation. If the category is a sub category, you might don't want it to be shown.

- Has a parent category - Explained above. If the category should inherit from another category. I.e "Cats" and "Dogs" are sub categories of "Pet animals".

- Attributes - The blueprint! This is what decides what will be possible to document in the category. "Pet Animals" might have attributes like "Name", "Age" and "Birthday". There is no limit on how many attributes you can use but you can only use one of each.
