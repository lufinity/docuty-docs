## Cloud Edition
After you have received your own docuty.se site you will be greeted with an installation page where you can specify what file system you are using if you would like to connect it to Docuty.

You will also be asked to create an admin account. Note that this is an account that is only used for initial setup and you need to create personal accounts for every user. The admin account is not counted amongst your total amount of users.
